Deprecated; you may consider [Timeriffic](https://github.com/hoijui/Timeriffic) instead.

The above mentioned repo started off with the exact same content, minus most of the binaries (namely `*.apk` and `*.jar`).

This is the original source code repo from the release of _Timeriffic v1.09.05_-
as found on the Mercurial repo on googlecode.com back then -
converted to git.
The last update was from 29. May 2011.

Generally speaking, the code is licensed under the GPL v3,
while the assets are released under the APL v2.
